this is the code of the paper "An asynchronously deep reservoir computing for predicting chaotic time series" https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106530

This is MATLAB implementation of asynchronously deep reservoir computing (ADRC).  Also, the code can implement ESN, Li-ESN and Deep-ESN by adjusting the key parameters.
